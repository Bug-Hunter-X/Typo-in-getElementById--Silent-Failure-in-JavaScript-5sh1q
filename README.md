# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common bug in JavaScript's interaction with HTML elements.  The bug stems from a simple typo in the `getElementById` function call, leading to unexpected behavior where the script fails silently without throwing any errors.

## Bug Description
The code attempts to change the text content of a div element with the ID "myDiv". However, a typo in the `getElementById` function prevents the element from being found and updated. This results in the original text remaining unchanged.  The error is extremely difficult to detect without careful code review and testing.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the text within the div element does not change, even though the JavaScript code seems to be attempting an update. 

## Solution
The solution involves correcting the typo in the getElementById function call. 

## Learning Points
- This highlights the importance of careful coding and rigorous testing to avoid such subtle errors.
- Typos in function names can result in hard-to-detect bugs.
- Using browser developer tools to inspect element properties can be valuable in debugging.
